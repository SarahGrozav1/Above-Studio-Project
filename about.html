           <h2 class="title">About Us</h2>
              <p class="about">Designing a space does not only require a visual approach, but it is about the process <br>
              of thinking itself, about skills, aspects that helped us define as our professional goal the <br>
              improvement of the quality and reality of our clients' lives through the projects we work on.<br>
              All interior design projects are based on understanding the client, the one whose state of mind <br>
              is influenced by the environment in which he lives, works or engages in relaxation activities. <br>
              His ideas, requirements and wishes are found in the project and are stylized and transformed into <br>
              functional, aesthetic ideas and are properly approached from a technical point of view.<br>
              When we "get to know" a new workspace, we take the time to analyze and feel all its transformation<br>
              possibilities, we look carefully for the signs that indicate how much potential there is for change <br>
              for the better, and we try to find as many strong points as possible. to start the concept. We believe that <br>
              any defect or supposed minus can take a positive form or can be enhanced by another element not identified<br>
              until that moment. Situations also happen during a project that are challenging for us as a designer and <br>
              this makes our work more dynamic, more exciting, helps us to surpass ourself and learn continuously. We believe<br>
              that there is at least one solution for any potential problem.</p>
