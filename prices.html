        <p>The plan of the space that you are going to arrange is sent by e-mail 
            together with some photos that show its current state.
            You will receive from us a questionnaire-type form to fill in, to help 
            us understand what your needs and wishes are related to the project.
            If there are aspects you want to mention and they are not in the questionnaire,
            you can write them separately from it in the same e-mail.
            We set the date and time of the consultation together and meet on zoom.
            After the consultation, you will receive an e-mail with the summary of the
            discussion and some sketched essential ideas, a list with suggestions of suppliers 
            and some reference pictures for obtaining visual information;
            The payment for this service is paid before the start of the consultation.</p>
